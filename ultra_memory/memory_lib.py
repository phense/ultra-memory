"""The single audited write path into memory.db.

Every function takes an open `conn` (the caller owns the short-lived connection,
per spec §6 single-writer discipline) and wraps its write in BEGIN IMMEDIATE/COMMIT.
All persisted text passes through redact_secrets first; every mutation writes an
audit_log row. No automatic fuzzy-batch deletion: consolidate = redirect-stub,
delete = soft tombstone.
